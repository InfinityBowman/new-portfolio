### Let's talk about why SolidJS is so amazing.

#### But first some background

I began my journey into web technologies and web development about a year and a half ago now. My first time touching JavaScript was Spring of 2024. Before, I was doing my degree in computer science and I loved computers and software but in my freetime I was making music or playing games. I was mostly using C#, C, and Python and I was not writing code outside of my course assignments. JavaScript was the most amazing thing I had ever seen and I've been addicted ever since. And I don't think it's just entirely JavaScript either, I really enjoy the whole ecosystem and the web as a platform. I then tried React and React was the most elegant solution for writing UIs and felt really nice. Then again, beforehand I had only been in the C# ecosystem and Kotlin/Java with Jetpack Compose which I had not been a big fan of either. It just felt clunky going back and forth with XML and the MVC and MVVM architecture with what I now know as 2-way data binding. It's also totally possible that I did not give Jetpack Compose a fair shake since the course I learned it in was a really crap course and we wrote super old android code and only got to Jetpack in the final two weeks of the semester. So I may go back at some point.

Since discovering the world of web programming, I have been learning everything I can and exploring all the things. Frontend, backend, SPAs, server rendering/components, API design, all the amazing browser APIs, how frontend frameworks work (virtual dom vs not), hosting, caching, etc etc. The list goes on. The world of the web and web applications is massive and amazing.

Okay, let's go back to React. I first learned about JavaScript a year and a half ago now. I mostly was writing vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, since that was what I was doing at my job. I started my senior capstone project and my team decided to jump straight into a cross platform React-Native app. In hindsight, this was not the wisest choice from my group but it turned out quite well (despite being a group of four, it was me doing most of the frontend and my friend doing most of the backend) and was a great learning experience. Fast forward a year, capstone is done, I'm doing my second summer at my same internship writing standard vanilla JS, HTML, CSS all the while I'm learning more and more about React. I started listening to podcasts (JavaScript Jabber), I went and watched all sorts of past conferences, follow a bunch of the cool open source projects and maintainters on Twitter, watching/listening to Ryan Carniato's streams, and most importantly, writing a ton of code. Also it's crazy btw, JavaScript library docs and tooling is so good compared to all the C# ones I've seen or had to use. And I've had to read a lot of the Microsoft docs. And I've read, probably by now, a majority of the MDN docs for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's no contest MDN is so good. Now, in all this I discover that there are tons of cool JavaScript UI libraries, not just React. There's Vue, Angular, Solid, Svelte, jQuery, Qwik, Astro, Inferno, Lit, and so many more.

#### Now about Solid

I first discovered Solid towards the end of this past summer, a few months ago at the time of writing.
